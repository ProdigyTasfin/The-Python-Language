"""Let a = 7 and b = 0.

If we write the code: 

a = input("Enter your 1st number: ")
b = input("Enter your 2nd number: ")

c = a+b 

print("1st number was: ",a)
print("2nd number was: ",b)
print("Sum of two number: ", c)

what will be the output

a) 7, 0, It's an error
b) 7, 0, 7
c) 7, 0, 70
d) 7, 0, False 


ANSWER IS C 7, 0, 70, BECAUSE THE INPUT IS STRING, STRING IS NOT BE ADDED, STRING IS CONCATENETED """
